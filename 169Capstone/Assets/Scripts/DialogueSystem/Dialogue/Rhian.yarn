    I understand skipping the small talk, but surely an introduction wouldn’t hurt. I’m Atlan and I’m trying to help with the, uh, situation on this ship.
    <<SetSpeaker Rhian>>
    Sure. Whatever. Name’s Rhian. You got electrum? Looking for weapons? If not, get out.

    Hey, Rhian, quick question about this ship–
    <<SetSpeaker Rhian>>
    Nevermind that! Guess what? Today I found out what happens if you light a lute on fire.
    <<SetSpeaker Player>>
    Okay. What happened?
    <<SetSpeaker Rhian>>
    Well, for starters, it was on fire.

    So, Rhian, about this ship–
    <<SetSpeaker Rhian>>
    Atlan, wait! I have to tell you, I found this <i>insane</i> sniper in storage! It has a laser scope and everything!
    <<SetSpeaker Player>>
    Sounds cool, but I’m not much of a sniper guy–
    <<SetSpeaker Rhian>>
    Well, good thing it’s not for you then isn’t it! Not everything is about you, Atlan!

    Hang on, check this out. I found this ridiculous rocket launcher down in storage, and you’ll never guess what it shoots.
    <<SetSpeaker Player>>
    R–

    IT SHOOTS ROCKETS! <i>Entire rockets,</i> Atlan! This thing is the best.

    Wait, <i>wait,</i> look at THIS! Look what I found! It’s… a… revolver! Can you believe it? They stopped making models like this <i>centuries</i> ago!
    <<SetSpeaker Player>>
    It’s beautiful.

    <<SetSpeaker Player>>
    So–
    <<SetSpeaker Rhian>>
    Hey, Atlan, look. I just… wanted to say. I really appreciate you talking to me all the time. Honestly, my parents never took my interests very seriously. They wanted me to be a bard, like them, but music was never really my thing, y’know? They even specifically named me <i>Rhiannon</i> after the legendary halfling lutist but like… Music was just that thing I did as a kid because I didn’t know any better and I was just going along with whatever my parents wanted for me, but as I grew up, I realized there was another kind of music I was more interested in.
    <<SetSpeaker Rhian>>
    Weapons make their own music, you just have to know how to make them sing. And I do. But my parents just… never really got <i>me.</i> But you’ve taken the time to talk to me, and I’ve seen you out there, a bit, and I know you <i>get it.</i> You know how to make your weapons sing, too.
    <<SetSpeaker Rhian>>
    What I’m trying to say is… I think you’re pretty cool. And I appreciate you. Or whatever.
    <<SetSpeaker Player>>
    … Thanks, Rhian.
    <<SetSpeaker Rhian>>
    Now buy some weapons or get out of my sight.

So, Rhian, I’ve been trying to ask… do you know about what’s going on here?
<<SetSpeaker Rhian>>
Oh, on the ship? Yeah, there’s all sorts of screwed up stuff going on. My memory gets all weird about it and it’s hard to keep track of how many times I’ve even seen <i>you</i> run through here but I definitely know SOMETHING is up. And very, very wrong.
<<SetSpeaker Rhian>>
But whatever. As long as I get to hang out here, I don’t really care about what’s going on out there.

    <<SetSpeaker Player>>
    All according to plan. But, uh, I don’t suppose you have any super special just-for-emergencies kill-everything-in-sight-instantly weapons I could try out?
    <<SetSpeaker Rhian>>
    Gods, I wish. Even if I did, you think I’d sell them to you? In this shape, you’d lose it as soon as you step outside my shop! I’m not <i>wasting</i> something like that!

    Obviously. It’s a great conductor, not to mention coolant. Why do you think the ship has pipes full of it? Anyway, I’ll give you a discount if you’ll let me scrape the goop from your boots!

Hey Rhian, you ever visit the moon Fengari? It’s not too far from where I first boarded this ship.
<<SetSpeaker Rhian>>
No. Why?
<<SetSpeaker Player>>
Oh, it’s a horrible place. Seedy bars, gambling dens, black market weapons deals everywhere you look. I actually won this here ray gun in a, uh, particularly high stakes game of cards. You find loads of people pawning off gear like this to feed their gambling problems. Or other addictions.
<<SetSpeaker Rhian>>
… Promise me you’ll take me someday! Please, I’ll do anything – I’ll even give you a discount!

I’m sure we can work something out.

    <<SetSpeaker Rhian>>
    What, no, it’s not for <i>you.</i> It’s not for <i>sale.</i>

    <<SetSpeaker Rhian>>
    I said <i>no such thing!</i> Come on, look at my B-tier stuff.

    Depends on what you’re getting. And where. Got any ideas?
    <<SetSpeaker Rhian>>
    Oh, yeah, loads. In fact, for the amount of tattoos I want, I’m raising my prices today. Gonna need <i>lots</i> of electrum to afford all that. Good thinking, Atlan.
