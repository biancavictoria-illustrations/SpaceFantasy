  reportNotes: Like the halflings who developed this device, the wrist rocket may
    be tiny but packs quite the punch. The artificers of Planet Laundagh are known
    for creating accessories both stylish and functional, and this is certainly no
    exception. Our very own weapons specialist has been amassing a significant stock
    of these instruments - I suspect we may need to discuss her intentions with that
    collection in the near future.
  itemType: Accessory
  mechanicalDescription: Fire a rocket that explodes on impact, dealing {INT} damage
    to all enemies within its radius.
