  reportNotes: Originally developed for use in the mines, the dwarves of Planet Svartallir
    have since developed variants of their sturdy trousers for combat use. These
    days, it would be uncommon to find a dwarf leaving their planet for an adventure
    without their own pair of multi-pocketed pants.
  itemType: Legs
  mechanicalDescription: Reduces move speed by 25% for 5 seconds, but doubles defense
    for the duration.
