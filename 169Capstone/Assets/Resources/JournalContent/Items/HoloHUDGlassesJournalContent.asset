  reportNotes: The outer-sector moon Fengari is home to many unsavory characters.
    Despite their questionable motives, the inventiveness of these misfits is certainly
    to be admired. These Holo HUD Glasses - modified equipment normally only accessible
    to the Petran military  - are quite popular on the black market for (illegal)
    use in (criminal) fight rings.
