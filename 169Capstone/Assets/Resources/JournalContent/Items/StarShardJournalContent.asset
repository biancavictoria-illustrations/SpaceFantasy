  reportNotes: My apprentice seems particularly interested in this substance. He
    insists it has hidden potential that needs only be discovered. I must advise
    he backs off, as I fear he may be correct. The unpredictable nature of such arcane
    substances is dangerous for even the most advanced mages to experiment with.
    I cannot allow him to harm himself or anyone else in his research.
  itemType: Currency
  mechanicalDescription: A substance of interstellar arcane origins that can be used
    in procedures to make the target grow stronger.
