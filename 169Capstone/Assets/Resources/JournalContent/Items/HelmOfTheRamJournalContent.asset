  reportNotes: Something about the dwarven crafting of this helm has caught the attention
    of my apprentice. He believes the magic channeled through this helm may be able
    to be amplified further. An interesting theory, though for what sort of practical
    applications, I cannot be certain. My apprentice must be advised that pushing
    boundaries for pride's sake is unwise.

  mechanicalDescription: Charge forward a short range, stopping early if you hit
    an enemy or obstacle. If an enemy is hit, it is dealt {200% STR} damage and and
