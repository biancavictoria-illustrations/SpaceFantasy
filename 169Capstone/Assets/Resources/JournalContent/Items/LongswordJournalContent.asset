  reportNotes: The Berserker's Blade is a type of weapon based on an ancient artifact
    once wielded by a legendary hero from Planet Svartallir. The myths state this
    individual could transform into a bear-like creature when provoked. Whether that
    power came from an inherent magic within herself or from the enchanted blade
    she carried is still highly debated. It is known, however, that the modern recreations
    inspired by her legendary sword do <i>not</i> give the user the same bear-like
    transformation... at least, as far as we've seen.
  itemType: Weapon
  mechanicalDescription: '<b>Active:</b> A heavy cleaving slash within melee range
    in front of you. Holding the attack button performs a combo attack, slashing
    up to 3 times, dealing {75% STR Damage}/{100% STR Damage}/{125% STR Damage} damage
    per swing.


    <b>Passive:</b> Upon killing an enemy, gain one stack of Berserker
    (up to a maximum of 3 stacks). Each stack of Berkserker increases attack speed
    by 20%. Lose one stack of Berseker after 3 seconds (resets after kill).'
