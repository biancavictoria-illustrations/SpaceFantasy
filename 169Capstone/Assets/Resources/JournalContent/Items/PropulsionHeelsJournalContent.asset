  reportNotes: Boots such as these have been the downfall of many brave adventurers.
    Long ago, during my own adventuring days, I once sported a pair myself. As I
    grew older, however, I learned to prefer Boots of Balance in their place. We
    are foolish to believe speed is the only route to victory - time is a sensitive
    thing, and insulting it leads to missteps from which you cannot recover.
  itemType: Legs
  mechanicalDescription: Quickly dashes in the direction you're moving. Scales with
    your current movement speed.
