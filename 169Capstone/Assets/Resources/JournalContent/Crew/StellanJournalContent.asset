  reportNotes: 'My apprentice is one of the most gifted mages I have ever seen. Perhaps
    too much so, for his own good.


    Yet still, I can see how he craves validation.
    His pride is but a guise to cover his desperation for approval. Nothing is ever
    enough for him, and he seems to view arcane limitations as challenges he must
    overcome in order to earn my respect.


    It saddens me that he does not see
    that he already has my respect. I truly hope that one day, with proper training,
    Stellan may even surpass my own skill.'
