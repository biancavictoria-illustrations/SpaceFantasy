  reportNotes: 'Dr. Sanguin is... concerningly efficient.


    A true master at
    his work, when he chooses to be. The other half of the time, his erratic behavior
    makes him unreasonable, unreliable, and dangerously unpredictable. His interest
    in experimental procedures is both to be commended and cause for a more careful
    eye on his work. I fear if left unchecked, the doctor may venture too far into
    the area of mad science.


    <b>UPDATE:</b>

    A series of investigations
    sparked by the complaints of crew members have led to a concerning discovery
    about the doctor''s credentials. There is reason to believe he may not have left
    Planet Silvestria of his own volition. My apprentice is assisting in trying to
    get to the bottom of this and find out what may truly lie in Sanguin''s past.'
