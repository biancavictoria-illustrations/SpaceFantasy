  reportNotes: '<b>ENTRY 1:</b>

    The caelarae of Planet Sanctus are a myth. I
    was certain of this fact, unwavering in my belief, until the stranger boarded
    the ship. A "human" -- but never have I seen a human with eyes the color of golden
    starlight cresting the horizon. He is brazen and foolhardy, but his reckless
    determination could prove useful.


    <b>ENTRY 2:</b>

    The doctor has taken
    note of this one, as well. Through their encounters, it seems the doctor has
    discovered traces of stardust in his blood. Perhaps my theories were correct,
    but only time will tell how his body holds up to the star shards in the long-term.


    <b>ENTRY
    3:</b>

    With each death, the star shards only empower him further. Fascinating,
    the capabilities of this arcane substance when united with one of the same origin.'
