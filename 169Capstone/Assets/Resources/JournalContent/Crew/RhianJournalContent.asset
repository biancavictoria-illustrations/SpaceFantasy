  reportNotes: "Rhian has come along way since she first joined our crew. When she
    first applied to be our Weapons Specialist, Rhian was just looking for a way
    off Planet Laundagh -- or, more specifically, away from her parents, I assume.\r\n\nSince
    running away from home and whatever responsibilities await her future, Rhian
    has been able to become her own person. I would like to think the environment
    we have fostered here on this ship has had something to do with that, but most
    of it is owed to Rhian\u2019s own embracing of her independence.\r\n\nIt is difficult
    to think she was once shy and reserved, considering that now she corners anyone
    within earshot to explain the mechanics of her latest build.\r"
