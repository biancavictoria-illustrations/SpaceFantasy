  reportNotes: 'Bryn''s kindness and optimism have been contagious on this ship.
    Even my sulllen apprentice cannot help but crack a smile at the way Bryn lights
    up any room he walks into.


    Bryn speaks of the smithing accident through
    which he lost his sight as though being blinded opened his eyes to the more genuine
    beauty of the world around him. A childhood near-death experience only made him
    more grateful for the time he had in this world, and he approaches even the most
    mundane tasks with the utmost enthusiasm.


    With the heart of the ship acting
    up in recent times, Bryn has taken it upon himself to care for the arcane reactor
    like a sick friend. His devotion to both his friends as well as his work cannot
    be beat.'
